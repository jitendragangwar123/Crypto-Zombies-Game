Chainlink:-
      :-Chainlink is a framework for decentralized oracle networks (DONs), and is a way to get data in from multiple sources across multiple oracles.
      :-This DON aggregates data in a decentralized manner and places it on the blockchain in a smart contract (often referred to as a "price reference 
      feed" or "data feed") for us to read from.
      :-Using Chainlink Data Feeds is a way to cheaply, more accurately, and with more security gather data from the real world in this decentralized context.
      :-The Chainlink network uses a system called Off-Chain Reporting to reach a consensus on data off-chain, and report the data in a cryptographically proven 
      single transaction back on-chain for users to digest.
      :-You can then make protocols like Synthetix, Aave, and Compound with this!
      ```
